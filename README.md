# Help Anybody Ethereum Crowd Funding 

Help Anyone, is a platform powered by Blockchain to help people build projects and crowdfund them. The 
projects can be anything from community service, civil structure restoration to movie making and gadget building. 
The projects can receive donations from anyone on the internet, with an Ethereum wallet and the proper usage of 
these funds are then moderated by volunteers on the website called, Moderators. Moderators validate completed 
withdrawals by the projects and award reputation tokens to the respective project creators. The project creators 
are incentivized by these tokens to keep submitting proof and perform valid transactions so that they can do more 
withdrawals and of larger amounts.

This is an ethereum based application that helps organisations and project leads maintain accountability and increase efficiency.
